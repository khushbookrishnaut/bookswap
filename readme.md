# BookSwap - Tokenized Book Exchange

## Project Description

BookSwap is a decentralized peer-to-peer book exchange platform built on the Aptos blockchain. This innovative smart contract enables book lovers to tokenize their physical and digital books, creating a trustless marketplace where users can list, discover, and purchase books using APT tokens. By leveraging blockchain technology, BookSwap eliminates intermediaries, reduces transaction costs, and ensures secure, transparent book exchanges between users worldwide.

The platform transforms the traditional book trading experience by providing instant settlements, immutable ownership records, and a global marketplace accessible 24/7. Whether you're a casual reader looking to exchange novels or a collector seeking rare editions, BookSwap provides a seamless, decentralized solution for book enthusiasts.
